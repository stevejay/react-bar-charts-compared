d3fc supports modern browsers. For pre-Edge versions of IE, you'll need a couple of polyfills in order to run d3fc code within the browser. The first is a polyfill for Symbol, such as es6-symbol, or the general babel-polyfill, and the second is a polyfill for CustomEvent, such as custom-event-polyfill.

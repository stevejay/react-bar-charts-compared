# react-bar-charts-compared

An SPA that demonstrates implementing a simple bar chart using various 
React.js charting solutions. A live demo is available [here](https://www.perspectivespace.com/react-bar-charts-compared/).

## Introduction

This repo is an exploration of free and paid charting solutions that can be used in a React.js SPA. Some of these are native React.js solutions and others
are JavaScript libraries that have React.js adaptors. A simple bar chart
has been implemented in each of the tested charting solutions.

## Implementation

The creation of this SPA served as an excuse to get experience in the following tech:
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Flow](https://flow.org/)

## Rejected Charting Solutions

- Taucharts
- [C3](http://c3js.org/), as it is for the earlier v3 version of d3.
